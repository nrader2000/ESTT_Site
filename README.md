# ESTT_Site
This repo contains all the content for my Node.js site!

How I locally test:
1. Make sure Node is installed on your machine.
2. There is a database that needs to be connected to the app (I usually setup a Apache XAMPP MYSQL server and host it on there locally if I need the site's access to it)
3. Open these source files in some editor with access to a terminal (I personally use Visual Studio Code)
4. cd over to /nodeapp within my source files using the terminal feature
5. enter "npm start" into the terminal
6. type localhost:3000 in your prefered browser
